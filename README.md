# Rock Paper Scissors
Zuri Python Task for creating the titular game. I made use of Python in creating the program. First, the player or user types in their gameplay which is either a rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S). Then the CPU also makes a play using random.choice(). The winner is arrived at using the classic rule for the game after which the program ends. If there's a tie, the game is repeated.
